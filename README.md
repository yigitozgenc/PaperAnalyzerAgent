# PaperAnalyzerAgent

## Overview

PaperAnalyzerAgent is an advanced AI-powered research assistant designed to transform how academics interact with scholarly literature. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models from OpenAI and Mistral, this collaborative system functions as a virtual research team that analyzes, interprets, and extends academic papers to accelerate scientific discovery and understanding.

## The Research Team (In Development)

PaperAnalyzerAgent deploys a specialized team of AI agents working in concert:

- **Research Engineer**: Implements code to reproduce experiments, validates mathematical models, and creates interactive visualizations of paper concepts
- **PhD Explainer**: Breaks down complex concepts with clear explanations of linear algebra, probability theory, and domain-specific knowledge
- **Research Scientist**: Generates novel research directions, identifies connections to other papers, and proposes potential extensions
- **Literature Reviewer**: Places the paper in broader academic context and identifies related work
- **Methods Analyst**: Evaluates experimental design, statistical approaches, and methodological strengths/weaknesses
- **Visual Interpreter**: Extracts meaning from figures, charts, and diagrams to enhance understanding

## Features (In Development)

- **Multi-Modal Understanding**: Process text, equations, figures, and tables from academic papers
- **Collaborative Analysis**: Coordinate insights across specialized AI agents for comprehensive understanding
- **Code Implementation**: Generate executable code to reproduce experiments and implement algorithms
- **Concept Visualization**: Create interactive diagrams to explain complex theoretical concepts
- **Research Extension**: Propose novel applications, improvements, and research directions
- **Customized Explanations**: Adapt explanations to different knowledge levels and backgrounds
- **Cross-Paper Synthesis**: Connect insights across multiple papers to identify emerging patterns

## Technical Architecture

PaperAnalyzerAgent is built on a modular architecture that combines:

- **Document Processing**: Advanced OCR capabilities using Mistral's technology for accurate text and equation extraction
- **Large Language Models**: Integration with OpenAI and Mistral's powerful language models for specialized reasoning
- **Vector Databases**: Efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings for semantic search
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordination system to manage specialized agents and synthesize their insights

## Development Status

This project is currently in early development. We are actively working on core functionality and will be expanding features in the coming weeks.
